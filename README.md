# Americana Project

## Overview

For WDI project #2, I created a web application called Americana.

The user creates an account. The user can then log in and view their profile page. The user can also view a page that lists all national parks, as well as detailed pages for each national park. The user can add a national park to their bucket list. The user can move a park from her bucket list to her parks visited list. The user can add notes and a review to visited parks.
